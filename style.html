                    of the university that as they equip students with the right knowledge and skills, they are also expected to give back to their community through community extension services.<br>
                    
                    <br>The College of Education advocates quality education through its ‘Sulat-Basa 123’ and ‘Math-Teknik’ which aims to develop the literacy and numeracy 
                    skills of the children in the community.<br>
                    
                    <br>The Hospitality Management Department conducts the Mugna sa Kusina not only as an income-generating project but also showcases a feast of flavors to the extensionists and beneficiaries.
                     This is also an avenue for them to promote the local products, such as Doc Dritz Suka and Squash Crackers, the local products produced in the Food Innovation Center of the campus.<br>
                    
                    <br>The College of Agriculture also has its livelihood program in swine production tagged as Organic Native Swine Expansion Technology (ONSET) to help the beneficiaries earn a living and to be able to provide for their family.
                     Likewise, the College of Technology organized skills and livelihood trainings through its extension program entitled Pagtudlo ug Paggama Pamaagi ug Welding (PPPAW).<br>
                    
                    <br>The College of Arts and Sciences conducted an extension program to the different elementary schools of DepEd Tuburan I. They brought along with them the projects of the AB English students to be distributed. 
                    The story books were translated from English to Sinugbuanong Bisaya, entitled “Palihug Paminawa Mi: Mga Sugilanon sa Kabataan sa Tuburan”. The book was inspired by the stories of the children in Tuburan that vary from suspense, 
                    fables, fantasy and myths but full of morals.<br>
                    
                    <br>These projects are all anchored in the seven principles made by the Education for Sustainability practitioners. It aims for transformation and change, for an education for all and lifelong learning, for systems thinking, 
                    for a better life in the future, critical thinking and reason, participation and lastly partnerships.<br>
                    
                    <br>As much as the UNESCO, the university believes that with quality education comes sustainability. The projects it has conducted outside the school premises show that the university upholds the utmost respect and commitment to its Vision, Mission, Goals and Objectives.<br>
                    
                    <br>Furthermore, Faculty members are sent to International Research Training at BIOTEC Thailand and in Australia for research presentations to boost the institution’s instruction and research. Consequently, board exam results are fascinating

                        Also, in the advent of the 2019 novel corona virus, the extension office and the fabrication laboratory work hand in hand to produce protective gears (face shields and face masks) in the neighboring towns and cities. The face shields are designed in the Fabrication laboratory of CTU Tuburan 
                        supervised by Mr. Siegfried Mendoza with its Lead Product Designer, Mrs. Zandra Mendoza. They respond automatically to the immediate and significant needs of the front liners in the region.<br>
                    
                    <br>CTU Tuburan also takes the front lead in the implementation of the Yolanda Recovery and Rehabilitation Program (YRRP) in the Yolanda- hit Northern towns and city of Cebu Province through sustainability programs to enhance the resiliency of the beneficiaries 
                    in a national- budgeted rehab project co- proposed by the Department of Agriculture. This program is a P 6.2 million- budget response of the Philippine government towards the havoc wreaked by super typhoon Yolanda in 2013.
                     This budget is allocated for rehabilitating the agriculture sector of the municipalities that have been hit by the super typhoon and CTU Tuburan has been chosen to the forefront of the project.
                      AACCUP Accreditation Survey and CHEDRO - Quality Assessments are always in the loop to maintain quality standards. Almost all programs in CTU Tuburan were accredited. Below are its programs and the status of its accreditation.<br></p>
